# A collection of offline single-file games.

A repo filled with more than a hundred offline games that can each run on a single file. This is a good option if you are having internet connectivity issues, or you're at some place with restricted internet.


No CDNs nor external frames, every game asset is inlined in the html file.


The downside of inlining everything is the file size. Use chunks.py to split them. You can use https://github.com/CoolDude2349/schoolworkforall/blob/main/code-inputer2.html for loading the chunks. The Epic Viewer also has an option.

The collection's updated regulary to add more offline games.
