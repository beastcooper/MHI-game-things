# A collection of offline single-file educational contents. 

No CDNs nor iframes, every asset is inlined in the html file.


Some files will be to large to copy and paste. Use chunks.py to split them. You can use https://github.com/CoolDude2349/schoolworkforall/blob/main/code-inputer2.html or https://github.com/CoolDude2349/schoolworkforall/blob/main/khanacademy/code-input-khan.html for loading the chunks. The Epic Viewer also has an option.
